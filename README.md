### Demo
Demo site: [https://yeikiu.github.io/vue-base-blog](https://yeikiu.github.io/vue-base-blog)

As a cool demonstration of the power of runtime markdown compilation I created a post entry which targets this README file directly: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yeikiu/vue-base-blog/master/README.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yeikiu/vue-base-blog/master/README.md)

Everything I change on this current file will be reflected on the blog post under the URL [https://yeikiu.github.io/vue-base-blog/#/guide/README](https://yeikiu.github.io/vue-base-blog/#/guide/README)
